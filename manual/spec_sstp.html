			<h1>SSTP/1.x</h1>
			<p>Reference: <a href="http://usada.sakura.vg/contents/sstp.html">SSTP</a> (External site)</p>
			<p>Currently, DirectSSTP relies heavily on Windows specifications and is not intended for implementation on other operating systems.
			<br />Since the IPC mechanism itself exists in other OSs, it would be desirable to define a separate specification.
			<br />If the specifications are decided, we will consider publishing them separately, so please contact <a href="https://github.com/ponapalt/ukadoc">Ukadoc Project</a>.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="category" id="sstp">
			<h1>Summary</h1>
			<p>SSTP is a general-purpose communication specification between ghosts. It can be used for simple SakuraScript playback, external event notification, etc.
			<br />Essentially, communication is done via TCP/IP. It listens on port 9801 or 9821 (SSP only), and when you send a request according to the SSTP protocol, the results of the processing are returned.
			<br />For security reasons, unless you change the settings, listening is now limited to localhost, and communication from outside the terminal is not possible. In the past, it also listened to port 11000, but this has now been discontinued as it was misidentified as communication by malware.
			<br />Although 7743 and 98901 are registered in <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=sakura+script">IANA's port number registry</a>, only 9801 is in actual operation.
			<br />There is a protocol with the same abbreviation, Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol, developed by Microsoft for VPN communication. There is no technical relationship between the two.
			<br />It does not take into account frequent communication that requires high performance, and does not have a keep-alive mechanism like HTTP. It disconnects at the end of each communication.</p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section class="category" id="direct">
			<h1>Direct SSTP</h1>
			<p>Direct SSTP is a communication specification that uses an IPC mechanism that is highly dependent on the OS. The protocol specifications are the same as (Socket) SSTP, but the purpose is to directly specify a ghost for lightweight communication without using TCP/IP, which requires relatively heavy processing.
			<br />Currently, the specifications have been determined only for Windows, and are as follows.</p>
			<section class="caption">
				<p>Send <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dataxchg/wm-copydata">WM_COPYDATA</a> using the SendMessage function (Post is not allowed)
				<br />hWnd in SendMessage = HWND of the target ghost, <a href="spec_fmo_mutex.html">obtained from FMO</a>
				<br />wParam = "own" HWND to which the reply is sent. The response is received by the HWND (window) that specified WM_COPYDATA.
				<br />lParam = pointer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-copydatastruct">COPYDATASTRUCT</a>
				<br />copydatastruct.lpData = String according to SSTP protocol
				<br />copydatastruct.cbData = String length
				<br />copydatastruct.dwData = 9801
				<br />Note:
				<br />For safety reasons, the sender should provide a zero-terminated string in lpData, and it is desirable that cbData also include a zero-termination.
				<br />For safety reasons, the receiver should not expect zero-termination, and should always take cbData into consideration when processing.
				<br />The receiving side should treat the HWND that was specified as the communication target as being equivalent to the ghost that was specified to receive in the SSTP protocol, and give priority to that ghost as much as possible.
				<br />It is intended only for GUI applications that have at least one window on both the receiving and sending sides, and cannot be used with console applications.</p>

			<h1>SSTP over HTTP</h1>
			<p>SSTP over HTTP, implemented in SSP 2.6.32, is an extremely simple mechanism that plugs the SSTP request directly into the HTTP request message body, and returns the SSTP response directly in the HTTP response body.
			<br />It is intended to be used to more easily exchange SSTP communications when an application is built using JavaScript, such as Electron.
			<br />POST to /api/sstp/v1 using HTTP/1.1 with Content-Type: text/plain, to localhost:9801 (or a separately specified SSTP port).
			<br />The response is also returned as-is, with HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/plain.
			<br />Note that even if the SSTP response is an error, HTTP is 200 OK.
			<br />Note that the Content-Length header is required, and an error will result if it is not present.</p>
			
			<p><a href="http://localhost:9801/api/sstp/v1">Demo</a></p>
			
			<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/ukatech/jsstp-lib/blob/master/docs/README_JP.md" target="_blank">the existing js library</a> to do SSTP over HTTP in js.</p>
			
			<p>Note: If the Origin header does not point to localhost, the request is forced to be treated as an SSTP request from a remote address. In that case, strong restrictions are placed on SakuraScript tags and SSTP methods that can be executed, and the SecurityLevel header is ignored.
			<br />This restriction is relaxed only when the Origin of HTTP is localhost and the SecurityLevel of SSTP is local.</p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section class="category" id="req_res">
			<h1>request/response</h1>
			<p>Like other protocols such as SHIORI, it is a proprietary protocol similar to HTTP.
			<br />It is mandatory to specify the Charset in the request; if it is not specified, an error will occur, or it will be interpreted as the charset specified by the OS standard.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The line feed code is CR+LF</li>
				<li>The request ends with a blank line (combined with the previous line, (CR+LF)x2).</li>
				<li>Additional data may be added at the end of the response in cases such as EXECUTE. After the header, a blank line is inserted, followed by additional data, and then another blank line to end the response. If there is no additional data, the response may end with a blank line immediately after the header.</li>
				<li>For compatibility reasons, responses with additional data may not have any headers, including Charset, and only the additional data may be returned. In that case, it can be assumed that the charset is the same as that of the request.</li>
				<li>The SSTP version of the request and the response may be different. Do not make interpretations that depend on the version number.</li>
